# Unity-Templates
A set of templates for games made with Unity. Each template has a simple implementation of a certain game mechanic with one or more sample levels.
A basic UI and level transitions (for templates with more than one level) are present to demonstrate the functionality of the game.

# Templates
* Amazeballs
* Smash Roller

# Amazeballs

Amazeballs is a clone of a mobile game where a ball must be moved through a maze. The maze floors is made up of cells and these cells will change color when the ball moves over them, each cell in the maze must be painted
to beat the level. The ball can only move in four directions, up down left and right. Movement is done through mouse movements. The left mouse button is pressed down and the ball will move in whichever direction the mouse is moved in afterwards.
The ball will move until it encounters a wall, so partial movement is not possible. A basic UI score counter is present and counts the number of floor panels that get colored when the ball moves over it.
Only one level is present for this template.

# Smash Roller

Smash Roller is a clone of a Japanese game series called "Katamari Damacy" a ball is rolled around by the player in an environment with various objects.
These objects stick to the ball and all their weight and mass is removed when the ball touches the objects. The player is tasked with sticking every object in the level onto the ball by touching them.
The ball is moved with the use of the arrow keys on the keyboard for demonstration purposes. A score counter counts each object that is stuck onto the ball as a point and increases the score counter by one.
When every object is stuck onto the ball in the first level the game will transition to the second level and vice versa.
Objects may be stacked on top of each other to "build" small structures that collapse when the ball smashes into them.
